I used `grid` for my final projectt in 201

`grid` is a css property that allows you to create easy to use spaces to place certain elements into. 

with `grid` you can manipulate each box to your specification. 

`flex-wrap` allows for elements within a box to cascade as needed if the box element isnt big enough to hold them all.

The properties of `justify-content` are below
`flex-start` aligns everything to the left of the box.
`flex-end` aligns everything to the right of the box.
`center` aligns everyting to the center of the box.
`space-between` puts as much space as possible between each element inside the box.
`space-around` puts space between the elements inside the box as well as the edges of the outer elements as well.
`space-evenly` self explanatory


`align-items` basically is the same as `justify-content` but for verticle alignments within a box

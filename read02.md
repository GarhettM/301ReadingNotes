Jquery object --> `$('li.hot')`

Method --> `.addClass('complete')`

$ uses CSS style syntax.

Might need this later
`:eq(index)` Elements with an index number equal to the one in the parameter

Page 304 references how to use selectors. Again, probably will need that later.

JQUERY USES INDEXS FOR CREATING OR TARGETING ELEMENTS! I CAN DO THAT FOR THE LAB02 IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE ELEMENTS I DONT WANT ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY WERE CREATED USING $!

Chaining allows you to use multiple methodds all oon the same line of code.

`.html()`

This method gives every element
in the matched set the same new
content. The new content may
include HTML.

`.replaceWith()`

This method replaces every
element in a matched set with
new content. It also returns the
replaced elements.

`. text()`

This method gives every element
in the matched set the same new
text content. Any markup would
be shown as text.

`. remove()`

This method removes all of the
elements in the matched set.
